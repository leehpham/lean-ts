# Contribution Guidelines

We have 2 branches:

- `develop`: Represents the development environment.
- `main`: Represents the production environment.

## Branching Workflow

1. Check out a feature branch from `main`:
2. Code and push commits to the feature branch.
3. Once finished, create a pull request to `develop`.
4. Request for code reviews.
5. If approved, the feature branch is merged to `develop`.
6. If all tests passed, create a pull request to `main`.
7. Request for code review.
8. If approved, the feature branch is merged to `main`.
